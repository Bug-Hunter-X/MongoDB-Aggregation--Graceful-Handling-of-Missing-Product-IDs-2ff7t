```javascript
const pipeline = [
  {
    $match: {
      status: 'active'
    }
  },
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: 'products',
      localField: 'product_id',
      foreignField: '_id',
      as: 'product'
    }
  },
  {
    $unwind: '$product'
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: '$product.category',
      totalSales: { $sum: '$amount' }
    }
  }
];

//This aggregation pipeline is intended to calculate total sales for each product category where the status is 'active'. However, if there are documents with `status: 'active'` but no matching product in the `products` collection due to incorrect `product_id` references, or if `product_id` is missing, the pipeline will not handle these cases gracefully. This may lead to missing sales data or unexpected results.  This issue becomes apparent when the `$unwind` stage attempts to process a `product` array that is empty.
