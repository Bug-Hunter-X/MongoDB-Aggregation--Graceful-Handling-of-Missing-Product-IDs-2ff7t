# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug: Missing Product IDs

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `$lookup`, `$unwind`, and `$group` stages in MongoDB aggregation pipelines.  The issue arises when dealing with potentially missing or incorrect foreign key references (`product_id` in this example). If there is no matching document in the `products` collection, the pipeline fails to handle this gracefully, leading to incomplete or inaccurate results.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous aggregation pipeline, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version that addresses the missing/incorrect product ID issue. 

The bug and solution are detailed in the JSON metadata file.
